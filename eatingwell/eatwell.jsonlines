Combine the ricotta, grated Parmesan and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl; add 3/4 cup flour and stir until just combined. Whisk egg and egg yolk in a small bowl and stir into the ricotta mixture until loosely combined. Generously dust a work surface with all-purpose flour and turn the dough out onto it. Gently knead the dough with floured hands; if it seems very wet and sticky, work in more flour, 2 tablespoons at a time, gently folding it over and continuing to dust the surface underneath until you&#39;re able to form it into a 3-by-6-inch log.With a floured knife, cut the log crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Starting at the center of the dough and pressing lightly with your fingers, roll each portion into a 3/4-by-15-inch rope, gently pulling and stretching the dough as you roll. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces and place on the prepared baking sheet. Place in the freezer until the gnocchi are frozen, about 30 minutes. (If making ahead, transfer to a sealable bag once frozen. Do not defrost before boiling.)To prepare sauce: If using fresh fava beans, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the shelled beans and cook for 30 seconds. Drain well. Remove the &#34;cap&#34; at the top and slip each bean out of its waxy coating.Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in asparagus, peas and the favas (or lima beans). Add broth, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the asparagus is almost tender, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.To cook gnocchi: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and drop in the frozen gnocchi. Cook, stirring gently, for 4 to 5 minutes. As the gnocchi float to the top, scoop them into a large bowl with a slotted spoon.Reheat the sauce, if necessary, and stir in butter, basil (or tarragon) and parsley.

Add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing (or pulsing) until the dough is evenly moist (but not wet) and is just starting to clump together, being careful not to overmix. Divide the dough into 2 pieces and pat each into a 5-inch disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.Remove the dough from the refrigerator; let stand for 10 minutes to warm up slightly (20 minutes if chilled more than 1 hour).Meanwhile, position a rack in center of oven and place a foil-lined baking sheet on the rack below; preheat to 425 degrees F.Roll one portion of dough between sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper into a 12- to 14-inch circle. Peel off the top sheet and invert the dough into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan. Peel off the remaining sheet. Moisten the outer edge of the dough with water.To prepare filling: Whisk maple syrup, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl. Add blueberries; toss to combine. Spoon the filling into the crust.To prepare lattice top: Roll the remaining dough between sheets of parchment or wax paper into a 12-inch circle. Peel off the top sheet. Cut the dough into about twelve 1-inch strips using a pastry wheel or knife. Lift off every other strip and lay them on top of the pie, leaving about a 1-inch gap between strips. Use the shorter strips for the edges and the longer ones for the middle of the pie. (You may not need to use the outermost strips.) To weave the lattice, fold the first, third and fifth strips back to the edge of the pie. Place a shorter strip of dough across the second and fourth strips, about 1 inch from the edge. Unfold the folded strips over the crosswise strip. Fold back the second and fourth strips over the first crosswise strip. Place another strip crosswise, about 1 inch from the first. Unfold the strips over the second crosswise strip. Continue folding back alternating strips and placing crosswise strips until the top is covered with woven strips. Trim any uneven edges and tuck the overhanging crust under the bottom crust; crimp or pinch the outer edge to seal the top and bottom crusts together. Brush just the lattice top (not the outer edge) with the egg white-maple mixture.Bake for 20 minutes. Rotate 180 degrees.Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees . Continue baking until the crust is golden and the filling is beginning to bubble, 50 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes more. (If you used fresh berries, the pie will be done sooner than if made with frozen berries.)

Bake directly on the center rack until tender when pierced with a knife, 45 minutes to 1 1/4 hours, depending on the size and type of your potatoes. Remove to a wire rack and let stand until cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes.Scoop the insides out of the potato skins and push through a potato ricer fitted with a fine disc onto a clean counter. (If you don&#39;t have a ricer, mash the potatoes until smooth.) Gather the potato into a mound on the counter, sprinkle with salt and let cool, about 15 minutes.Put a large pot of water on to boil.Pour egg yolk over the cooled potato and then sprinkle 1 cup flour on top. Use a bench knife or metal spatula to gently fold the flour and egg into the potatoes until combined (it will not look like dough at this point). Gently squeeze, knead and pat the dough until it holds together and resembles biscuit dough or cookie dough. The dough will be a little sticky; if it&#39;s very sticky, add more flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, as necessary. Be careful not to overwork the dough: overworked dough will yield tougher gnocchi.Pat the dough into a 1 1/2-inch-thick disk and then divide it into 4 equal pieces. Working on a lightly floured surface with lightly floured hands, roll each portion into a 24- to 26-inch-long &#34;snake,&#34; 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide. Start at the center of the dough and roll out using your fingertips and very light pressure; gently pull the dough out as you roll. Cut the snake into 3/4-inch pieces. Use your fingertip to make an indentation (or &#34;dimple&#34;) in the center of each gnocchi. Place the gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet as they are made. Repeat with remaining dough.Adjust the heat so the water is at a gentle boil. Add about one-quarter of the gnocchi at a time. When the gnocchi float to the top, transfer to a parchment or wax paper-lined baking sheet with a slotted spoon.

Whisk 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon coconut extract and 1/4 teaspoon salt in another medium bowl. Combine the remaining 2 1/2 cups milk, coconut milk and 2/3 cup sugar in a large saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until steaming but not bubbling. Whisk the hot milk into the cornstarch mixture, then return the mixture to the saucepan and bring to a full boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.Gradually whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture. Strain through a sieve into a bowl or storage container. Cover and refrigerate until cold, 4 hours or up to 2 days.To prepare cranberry filling: Combine cranberries, cranberry juice, 1 cup sugar and honey (or agave) in a large saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until most of the cranberries burst open, 7 to 10 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Or transfer to a storage container and refrigerate for up to 2 days.To prepare sponge cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large (12-by-16 1/2-inch) rimmed baking sheet (half sheet pan) with parchment paper. Trim the paper so it covers the bottom of the pan completely, but does not curl up the sides. Coat the paper and pan sides with cooking spray. Place 5 eggs (in the shell) in a stand mixer bowl or large mixing bowl, add very warm tap water and set aside to warm the eggs and bowl.Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling occasionally, until the white flecks of milk solids in the bottom of the pan start to turn golden brown, 4 to 8 minutes. Scrape into a medium bowl. Let cool to room temperature, then stir in 2 teaspoons coconut extract. Set aside.Meanwhile, whisk whole-wheat pastry flour and cake flour in a medium bowl; set aside.Drain the water and break the eggs into the warmed mixing bowl. Add 2/3 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until tripled in volume and very pale light yellow, 5 to 15 minutes (depending on the strength of your mixer). To test if it&#39;s beaten well enough, lift the beater from the batter: as the batter falls off the beater into the bowl, it should mound for a moment on the surface.Gently fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture with a whisk, in two additions, until just incorporated. Gently fold about 1 cup of the batter into the reserved butter. Then gently fold the butter mixture into the bowl of batter with a whisk until just incorporated, being careful not to overmix. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared baking sheet.Bake the cake until puffed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 8 to 12 minutes. Cool in the pan on a large wire rack for 10 minutes. Gently run a knife around the edges and turn the cake out onto the rack; remove the parchment and let cool completely.To assemble trifle: Cut the cake into 1-inch cubes. Spread about 1 cup of the custard in the bottom of a trifle dish. Top with about 3 cups cake cubes and 1 cup of the cranberry filling. Repeat the layering 3 more times.To prepare topping: Just before serving, whisk or beat cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Whisk in yogurt, confectioners&#39; sugar and 1 teaspoon coconut extract until smooth. Spread over the top of the trifle.
